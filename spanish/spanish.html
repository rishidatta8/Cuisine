            Spanish cuisine is heavily influenced by historical processes that shaped local culture and
            society in some of Europe's Iberian Peninsula territories. Geography and climate have had a
            great influence on cooking methods and available ingredients. These cooking methods and ingredients
            are still present in the gastronomy of the various regions that make up Spain. <br>

            <span class="para2">Spanish cuisine
            derives from a complex history where invasions and conquests of Spain have modified traditions
            which made new ingredients available. Thus, the current and old cuisine of Spain incorporates old and new traditions.</span>
